Simple utility to test out Rapid Serial Visual Presentation
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Serial_Visual_Presentation

This was just a quick prototype thrown together to have a simple desktop application
that could display a given text using the RSVP method.
This implementation doesn't add pauses based on punctuation.
Implemented using Java and JavaFX.

Configuration options
=====================
You can configure the Word per Minute, i.e. the speed which words are shown.
The number of words shown at the same time.

Requirements
============
Java 7u12 or newer (I think) only tested with u51.
